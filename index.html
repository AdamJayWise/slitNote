    <h2>Spectral Resolution and Slit Width</h2>
    <h4>...and why can't I set it to one micron?</h4>

    <p>Mechanical slits are a nearly universal feature of spectrometers.  They restrict the light as it enters, forming a narrow
        aperture suitable for dispersing into a spectrum.  A wider slit allows more light through, but the wider image it forms
        reduces the ability to resolve spectral features.  A narrower slit creates fine spectral lines, but potentially at the cost of accepting less
        light from our source.
        
    </p>

    <p>
        Hypothetically, if we had plentry of light and wanted to achieve the best possible spectral resolution, could we simply close the slit
        further and further, squeezing the light entering into a narrow and narrow line?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Sadly, no.  First, even in a perfect world diffraction would eventually catch up with us, spreading out the image of our
        super-narrow slit.  But before we hit that limit, there are two factors that limit the real-world resolution of the spectrometer.
    </p>
        
        <h3>Imaging Performance - PSF</h3>
    <p>
        No imaging system is perfectly sharp.  The extent of this "blur" can 
        be described as a point spread function (PSF) or line spread function (LSF).  That is to say, the image of an infinitely-narrow 
        slit will be broadened through imperfect imaging into a slightly-blurred line of finite width. At very small slit widths,
        the width of the image at the detector is dominated by the spectrometer's spread function.  At larger slit widths, the small bit of blurring
        is inconsequential, and our image at the detector looks like the actual slit aperture.  This is why the curve showing the relationship
        between slit width and resolution looks the way it does - it's linear when the slit width is large and the "fuzziness" at the edges is 
        unimportant, but at small slit widths, the resolution hits the "floor" of the spectrometer imaging performance.
    </p>

    <h3>Pixel Size</h3>
    <p>
        The other factor that limits real-world spectrometer resolution is pixel size.  Our image at the detector must be recorded, 
        and with a digital camera this is done by recording the image across an array of pixels.  The size of each pixel represents
        another hard limit for resolution.  A super-narrow line projected onto a detector with big pixels will look exactly as wide
        as a single pixel - or sometimes two, if we're unlucky and hit the array of pixels right along a seam.
    </p>

    <h3>Simulation</h3>
    <p>
        Below is a simulation showing three lines coming from a spectrally-narrow source - say, a gas discharge lamp - imaged 
        through a spectrometer with an adjustable slit onto a detector.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Try changing the slit width.  What happens to the measured width and "brightness" of the lines? 
            </li>
            <li>
                Try changing the pixel size.  What happens to the "brightness" of the lines? Can they still be clearly resolved as separate features when the pixel size is large?
            </li>
            <li>
                Try setting the pixel size high - say 50&mu;m - and changing the slit width.  Do you see much change (other than peak height) with changing slit width?
            </li>
        </ul>
