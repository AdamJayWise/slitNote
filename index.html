    <h2>What is the purpose of a spectrometer slit?</h2>
    <h4>... and why can't I set it to one micron?</h4>

    <p>Mechanical slits, whether fixed, manually operated, or motorized, are an almost universal feature at the entrance port 
        of a spectrometer.  They let us shape the light entering the system, preparing a tall, thin source suitable for 
        dispersing into a spectrum.  For a light source with a large spatial extent - for example, the image of a bright light
        bulb focused with a magnifying glass onto the spectrometer's input - we can open an adjustable slit wide to let lots of
        light in, at the cost of decreased spectral resolution, or pinch it down into a thin vertical stripe, letting in a 
        meagre amount of light, but shaped into an ideal vertical band perfect for spreading out in a well-resolved spectrum.
    </p>

    <p>
        But can we close the slit down further and further until we achieve infinitely high spectral resolution?  Sadly, no -
        eventually, the imaging performance of the spectrometer becomes the limiting factor.  This limit can 
        be described as a point spread function (PSF) or line spread function (LSF).  That is to say, an infinitely-narrow 
        slit will be broadened through imperfect imaging into a line of finite width.  As the slit is opened the width of the 
        slit combines with the spread function, at first making up only a small part of the total broadening, but at larger
        width dominating completely.  This is why the curve showing the relationship between slit width and resolution looks 
        the way it does - it's linear when the slit width is large and the "fuzziness" at the edges is inconsequentional, but at
        small slit widths, the resolution hits the "floor" of the spectrometer imaging performance.
